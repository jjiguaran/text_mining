    "### Introduction\n",
    "Topic Models, in a nutshell, are a type of statistical language models used for uncovering hidden structure in a collection of texts. In a practical and more intuitively, you can think of it as a task of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**, where rather than representing a text T in its feature space as {Word_i: count(Word_i, T) for Word_i in Vocabulary}, you can represent it in a topic space as {Topic_i: Weight(Topic_i, T) for Topic_i in Topics}\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning**, where it can be compared to clustering, as in the case of clustering, the number of topics, like the number of clusters, is an output parameter. By doing topic modeling, we build clusters of words rather than clusters of texts. A text is thus a mixture of all the topics, each having a specific weight\n",
    "- **Tagging**, abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents that best represents the information in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several existing algorithms you can use to perform the topic modeling. The most common of it are, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA/LSI), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll take a closer look at LDA, and implement our first topic model using the sklearn implementation in python 2.7\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Overview\n",
    "LDA is a generative probabilistic model that assumes each topic is a mixture over an underlying set of words, and each document is a mixture of over a set of topic probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LDA_Model](https://github.com/chdoig/pytexas2015-topic-modeling/blob/master/images/lda-4.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe the generative process of LDA as, given the M number of documents, N number of words, and prior K number of topics, the model trains to output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `psi`, the distribution of words for each topic K\n",
    "- `phi`, the distribution of topics for each document i\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters of LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Alpha parameter` is Dirichlet prior concentration parameter that represents document-topic density — with a higher alpha, documents are assumed to be made up of more topics and result in more specific topic distribution per document.\n",
    "- `Beta parameter` is the same prior concentration parameter that represents topic-word density — with high beta, topics are assumed to made of up most of the words and result in a more specific word distribution per topic."

    "### What is Topic Coherence?\n",
    "Perplexity is often used as an example of an intrinsic evaluation measure. It comes from the language modeling community and aims to capture how surprised a model is of new data it has not seen before. It is measured as the normalized log-likelihood of a held-out test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focussing on the log-likelihood part, you can think of the perplexity metric as measuring how probable some new unseen data is given the model that was learned earlier. That is to say, how well does the model represent or reproduce the statistics of the held-out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, past research has shown that predictive likelihood (or equivalently, perplexity) and human judgment are often not correlated, and even sometimes slightly anti-correlated. And that served as a motivation for more work trying to model the human judgment, and thus Topic Coherence.\n",

    "The topic coherence concept combines a number of papers into one framework that allows evaluating the coherence of topics inferred by a topic model. But,\n",

    "Topic Coherence measures score a single topic by measuring the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic. These measurements help distinguish between topics that are semantically interpretable topics and topics that are artifacts of statistical inference. But,\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is coherence?\n",
    "A set of statements or facts is said to be coherent, if they support each other. Thus, a coherent fact set can be interpreted in a context that covers all or most of the facts.
